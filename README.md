The Lex program
Lex.c      | Uses the List ADT (List.h) to sort a given input of letters in lexicographic order into an output file
List.c     | All Functions created from the prototypes in List.h
ListTest.c | Testing file used to test functions from List.c all tests are outputed on the line
List.h     | Prototypes of functions that will be used in the lex program
Makefile   | Compiles and Makes the Lex program as well as other testing code optionally
	   | Note: Given Makefile kept saying Lex.c didn't exsist so a new one was created differing from the original, works perfectly
